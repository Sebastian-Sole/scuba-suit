# Documentation Maintenance Workflow

## 🎯 **Core Principle**

Every completed task MUST update the knowledge base. Future developers (including yourself) depend on accurate, up-to-date documentation.

### **Critical Constraints**

- **AGENTS AND COMMANDS ARE IMMUTABLE**: Never modify files in `.claude/agents/` or `.claude/commands/`
- **Research drives planning**: All plans must be based on comprehensive research
- **Documentation is source of truth**: Always update documentation after task completion
- **Experiences capture learning**: Document both successes and failures for future reference

## 📋 **Mandatory Documentation Steps**

### **After ANY Development Task**:

#### 1. **Update Ticket Status** (Always Required)

```bash
# File: .claude/tickets/[ticket-number]-[description].md
- Mark completed acceptance criteria: [ ] → [x]
- Update ticket status if applicable
- Add completion notes and lessons learned
- Reference any new experiences created
```

#### 2. **Document Experiences** (When Applicable)

Create new experience files for:

- ✅ **Complex implementations** - Working patterns and configurations
- ❌ **Failed approaches** - What didn't work and why
- 🔍 **External library integration** - API discoveries and gotchas
- 🚨 **Unexpected issues** - Bugs, compatibility problems, workarounds
- 💡 **Novel solutions** - Creative workarounds and innovative approaches
- 📚 **Research findings** - Comprehensive research results from sub-agents

#### 3. **Update Rules** (When Needed)

Modify existing rules for:

- 🚫 **New "don'ts"** - Things that caused problems
- ✅ **New coding patterns** - Successful approaches to follow
- 📚 **Dependency updates** - Version changes, compatibility notes
- 🎯 **Scope changes** - Feature additions/removals
- 🔧 **Process improvements** - Workflow and methodology updates

#### 4. **Create New Tickets** (When Needed)

Use `@create-ticket.md` command for:

- Follow-up work identified during implementation
- Related features discovered during development
- Bug fixes or improvements needed
- Technical debt items

## 📂 **File Organization**

## 🚨 **Critical Documentation Triggers**

### **ALWAYS Document When**:
1. **External Library Issues**
   - Props don't work as expected
   - Type definitions are wrong
   - Version compatibility problems
   - Hey API client generation problems
   - Panda CSS recipe compilation errors
   - NextAuth Azure AD configuration issues

2. **TypeScript/Compilation Errors**
   - Complex error resolution
   - Type system workarounds
   - Build configuration changes
   - Complex API type resolution
   - Panda CSS type system workarounds
   - Next.js build configuration changes

3. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Why you chose approach A over B
   - Performance considerations
   - Future scalability decisions
   - Why you chose specific visualization approach
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - Responsive design implementation decisions

4. **Integration Challenges**
   - API connection issues
   - Real-time data flow problems
   - State management complexities
   - Backend API connection issues
   - Authentication flow problems
   - Data table performance complexities

5. **Research Discoveries**
   - New patterns found during codebase research
   - Integration approaches that work
   - Performance optimizations discovered

### **NEVER Skip Documentation For**:
- ❌ "Simple" bug fixes (they often reveal bigger issues)
- ❌ "Temporary" workarounds (they become permanent)
- ❌ "Obvious" solutions (not obvious to others)
- ❌ Failed experiments (future developers will try the same thing)
- ❌ Research findings (even if not immediately actionable)

## 🔄 **Documentation Update Checklist**

After completing ANY task, verify:

- [ ] **Ticket updated**: Acceptance criteria marked complete
- [ ] **Experience documented**: If task was complex or failed
- [ ] **Research saved**: If comprehensive research was conducted
- [ ] **Rules updated**: If new patterns/constraints emerged
- [ ] **Code examples included**: Working implementations documented
- [ ] **Future considerations noted**: What's next or what to avoid
- [ ] **New tickets created**: If follow-up work is needed

## 📊 **Quality Standards**

### **Good Documentation**:
- ✅ Specific code examples that work
- ✅ Clear problem/solution descriptions
- ✅ Actionable next steps
- ✅ Lessons learned that prevent future issues
- ✅ Cross-references to related tickets, plans, and research

### **Poor Documentation**:
- ❌ Vague descriptions ("it didn't work")
- ❌ No code examples
- ❌ Missing context about why something was needed
- ❌ No consideration of future impact
- ❌ No references to related work

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Documentation is Effective When**:
- Future developers can avoid repeated mistakes
- Complex setups can be replicated from docs alone
- Project scope and boundaries are clear to all
- Technical decisions have recorded rationale
- Research findings are easily discoverable and actionable

### **Warning Signs**:
- Repeating the same research/debugging
- Unclear why certain architectural decisions were made
- New team members can't get up to speed quickly
- Code reviews reveal patterns not documented in rules
- Research findings are not being utilized in planning

## 📚 **Workflow Example: Ticket #0001 Dashboard Implementation**

### **Proper Documentation Flow Demonstrated**

The performance metrics dashboard implementation (ticket #0001) exemplifies the complete documentation workflow:

#### **1. Ticket Status Updates** ✅
- **File**: `.claude/tickets/0001-performance-dashboard-implementation.md`
- **Action**: Marked completed acceptance criteria from `[ ]` to `[x]`
- **Added**: Completion notes with key components, API integration summary, and references
- **Result**: Clear record of what was accomplished and what remains

#### **2. Experience Documentation** ✅
- **File**: `.claude/experiences/projects-table-implementation-success.mdc`
- **Content**: Comprehensive implementation details with working Panda CSS recipes
- **Value**: Future data table implementations can follow proven patterns
- **Cross-references**: Links to related tickets, plans, and research

#### **3. Research Documentation** ✅
- **File**: `.claude/experiences/research/hey-api-authentication-analysis.md`
- **Purpose**: Documented Azure AD token handling and API client configuration
- **Impact**: Prevented repeated debugging of authentication flow issues

#### **4. Implementation Artifacts** ✅
- **Plan File**: `.claude/plans/0001-performance-dashboard-implementation/250924.md`
- **Component Files**: ProjectsTable, TitleHeader, and related UI components
- **API Integration**: Hey API client configuration and type definitions

### **Key Success Factors**

1. **Immediate Documentation**: Updated ticket status upon completion
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Documented both successes and challenges
3. **Future-Focused**: Included specific Panda CSS examples and gotchas
4. **Cross-Referenced**: Connected related documentation pieces
5. **Actionable Insights**: Clear next steps and follow-up tickets identified

### **Documentation Completeness Checklist**

Using ticket #0001 as the standard:

- [x] **Ticket marked complete** with specific completion notes
- [x] **Experience file created** with implementation details
- [x] **Code examples included** that can be copied and adapted
- [x] **Gotchas documented** to prevent future issues
- [x] **Cross-references added** between related documentation
- [x] **Follow-up work identified** (ticket #0002 for project detail views)
- [x] **Research saved** for authentication configuration troubleshooting

This comprehensive documentation enables:
- **Rapid onboarding** of new developers
- **Confident iteration** on existing dashboard features
- **Efficient troubleshooting** of similar UI/API issues
- **Informed planning** of related analytics features

## 🚀 **Agent Integration Guidelines**

### **Working with Sub-Agents**:
- Always wait for all sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding
- Use research findings to inform planning decisions
- Document agent discoveries in experience files
- Reference agent research in implementation plans

### **Command Usage**:
- Use `@create-plan.md` for comprehensive planning
- Use `@research-codebase.md` for deep investigation
- Use `@create-ticket.md` for follow-up work
- Use `@implement-plan.md` for execution
- Never modify agent or command files

### **Documentation Flow**:
1. Research → Save to `.claude/experiences/research/`
2. Planning → Save to `.claude/plans/`
3. Implementation → Update ticket status
4. Learning → Save to `.claude/experiences/`
5. Process improvement → Update rules

---

**Remember**: Documentation is not overhead - it's an investment in project velocity and code quality. The agent-based workflow ensures comprehensive research drives informed planning, which leads to better implementations and continuous learning.
