# Project Scope & Boundaries

## 🎯 **Project Vision**

A responsive web application that displays and analyzes code performance metrics for Knowit projects and their customers' projects. The application provides comprehensive scoreboard functionality with project analytics, performance tracking, and interactive data visualization.

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

```
Backend API → Hey API Client → React Frontend
      ↓             ↓              ↓
  Performance    Auto-generated  Dashboard
   Metrics       Types/Client    Components
```

### **Component Responsibilities**

#### **This Frontend (Our Scope):**

   - Role-based access patterns

### **Technical Implementation**

```typescript
// Core data flow
API → Hey Client → React Components → User Interface

// Key components
<ProjectsTable
  projects={projectData}
  onSort={handleSort}
  onFilter={handleFilter}
/>
<Dashboard
  metrics={performanceMetrics}
  analytics={analyticsData}
/>
```

## 🎮 **User Stories (In Scope)**

### **Primary User: Project Manager/Developer**

1. "I want to see performance metrics for all my projects at a glance"
2. "I want to drill down into specific project details"
3. "I want to track performance improvements over time"
4. "I want to compare different projects' performance"
5. "I want the interface to be fast and responsive on my device"

### **Secondary User: Stakeholder/Client**

1. "I want to view project performance in an easy-to-understand format"
2. "I want to see progress trends and improvements"
3. "I want to access the dashboard from any device"
4. "I want to understand what the metrics mean"

### **Tertiary User: Administrator**

1. "I want to ensure only authorized users can access the data"
2. "I want the system to handle errors gracefully"
3. "I want fast loading times and smooth interactions"

## 🔧 **Technical Boundaries**

### **Dependencies We Control**

```json
{
  "next": "15.5.2",
  "react": "19.2.0",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
  "next-auth": "5.0.0-beta.29",
  "@hey-api/openapi-ts": "^0.83.1",
